# CS50x

Contains my solutions to the problem sets for Harvard's [CS50x intro to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/).

If you are currently taking CS50x or CS50 (especcially if you are an enrolled Harvard student!), make sure you are familiar with the course's [academic honesty policies](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/syllabus/#academic-honesty) before looking at my solutions.
